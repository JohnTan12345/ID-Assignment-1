# Chill Studio's Showcase Website
 
This website is to provide other developers who wants a studio to maintain their game information on how the other developers rate the studio and sway their judgement to letting us manage their game when they do not have the time to.

## Design Process

This website is for a game developer who wants to shove the responsibility of maintaining their game to a studio so they don't have to. It also acts as a portfolio for the studio itself.

Lets say a developer has a lot of ideas to implement, but it would take them at least a year to implement them all into the game. They would go to this website to see the game that the studio has worked on, check the state of the game, then contact them to collaborate with the studio on the game
Lets also say the studio just collaborated with another developer to maintaining their game and it became one of the most popular game that they maintained, They would have to add it to the list of games they maintained and then put the game as the top 5 of its most popular games in its website.

Within these 2 scenarios, I believe that the website will be able to achieve both goals for both users as the website acts as a portfolio while also giving the developer info of what they do and where they can contact them.
